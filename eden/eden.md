## How to speed up DAoC load times:

+ Press the Windows key and type "Windows Security" then select it
+ On the left click "Virus & Threat protection" and then "Manage Settings"
+ Scroll down to the Exclusions section and click "Add or remove exclusions"
+ Click the button "+ Add an exclusion" then click "Process" from the dropdown menu
+ Type in "game.dll".
+ Then click "Add" and if presented with a UAC prompt, click "Yes" to confirm you want to add the entry.
+ Load DAoC as normal to see the benefits.


+ Only for those who still have very long loading times:
Add patchui.dll and game.dll as file type exclusions. Make sure to pick the ones from the used Eden folder.
