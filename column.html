	<b><u>How to be a highly competitive 50RvR hunter</u></b><br>
	<p>
		<b>Playstyle</b><br>
		In the current state of the game, with a low defense class such as the hunter, you should avoid melee fights, especially against assassins; in agreement with that the only specs that I suggest are the sniper one, bow/beastcraft and the hybrid one, bow/spear/beastcraft.<br>
		The crucial points with this playstyle are 1) kiting*;and 2) choosing the right fights. As far as number 2) is concerned, your best hunting places will be side/top of bridges, water, and other terrain osbtacles that will help you create a gap between u and your enemies.<br>
		If you do not want to waste cooldown abilities it is essential to be the first to attack/see the enemy, which will be easily achieved through MoS9, stealthlores and call of the hounds ability: remember to always pan your camera even when stealthed!<br>
		As i mentioned before, the key in playing a kiting hunter is to never EVER get in melee range with your opponents, especially the ones that can snare/hinder you easily, this means that sometimes killingan enemy will require more time than expected.<br>
		Obviously lets not forget the melee part of the hybrid spec which is good for killing or finishing off softer targets such as rangers, scouts, supports and casters without too much "running around".<br>
		ATTENTION: In the current state of the game, especially at lower ranks and with a more melee oriented spec, avoid -I repeat- AVOID engaging in a melee fight any sort of assassin, after the posion love, well geared/ranked assasin can literally 3-4 round you, so, opening from range with critshot plus cl disease and instant pet gives you a good chance of surviving and collecting rps!<br>
		Despite the fact that this is probably the most efficient and smartest way to play a hunter, a big part of the game community considers the above tactics "cheesy" and unfair or simply prefers to smack down enemies with the two-handers, I just think that this is how the class should be played to get the most out of it.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Race and starting points</b><br>
		The best race for a sniper hunter is kobold, since dexterity is the most important stat and kobbies got the smallest size; valkyn is another good choice, especially if you want to spec hybrid: high quickness and 5% cold and body resists are great!<br>
		You have to adjust your starting point to reach the right amount of dex, so it depends on your template, aug dex, buffs and race**.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Specs</b><br>
		The level 50 pet summon ability is a must if you are not hybrid!<br>
		Stealth: composite 50, always.
		<ul>
			<li>sniper spec: 50 beastcraft rest archery</li>
			<li>hybrid spec: 39 spear rest archery/beastcraft (at least 32)</li>
			<li>hybrid spec2: 34 spear rest archery/beastcraft</li>
		</ul>
		examples:
		<ul>
			<li>realm rank 5 full sniper spec: 47 archery, 50 beastcraft, 35 stealth</li>
			<li>realm rank 5 hybrid spec: 39 spear, 46 archery, 33 beastcraft, 35 stealth</li>
			<li>realm rank 9 full sniper spec: 50 archery, 50 beastcraft, 31 stealth</li>
			<li>realm rank 11 hybrid spec: 34 spear, 47 archery, 41 beastcraft, 29 stealth</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Realm abilities spec and progression</b><br>
		You need long wind 1 and Master of Stealth9 as soon as possible, then you need aug dex to reach the dex break point, high level of purge and Falcon's Eye.<br>
		Wild minion 1 unlocks your pet's crit chance!<br>
		If you are hybrid and high ranked, you can also put your points in Master of Pain.<br>
		Last but not least, a hunter played correctly doesnt need Ignore Pain or Master of Concentration, save your points for more userfull things!.<br>
		<br>examples:
		<ul>
			<li>realm rank 5L0 full sniper spec: LW1, MoS9, Aug Dex3, Wild Minion1</li>
			<li>realm rank 11L0 full sniper spec: LW1, MoS9, Aug Dex3, purge5, Falcon's Eye8, Wild Minion3</li>
			<li>realm rank 10L9 hybrid spec: LW1, MoS9, Aug Dex3, purge5, Falcon's Eye6, Master of Pain6</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Master Level's path</b><br>
		Sojurner is the way to go, lets take a quick look at this ML path:
		<ol>
			<li>Unburdened Warrior: it allows you to carry heavier things such as siege stuff</li>
			<li>Unending Breath: it allows you to swim faster then nereid potions!</li>
			<li>Reveal Crystalseed: reveals all enemy runes around your ground target</li>
			<li>Unmake Crystalseed: destroys the targeted rune, and any runes immediately nearby</li>
			<li>Ancient Transmuter: summons a vendor to sell stuff</li>
			<li>Gateway: teleport to your bindpoint</li>
			<li>Resistance of the Ancients: blesses you with resistance to Essence magic</li>
			<li>Forceful Zephyr: Pet-type summon that picks up the specified enemy target and carries them off. Target is immune to damage while under the effect of the Zephyr</li>
			<li>Phase Shift: self buff that provides invulnerability to spells and melee for 10 seconds instantly draining 50% of your endurance </li>
			<li>Mass Gateway: Teleports your group to your bindpoint</li>
		</ol>
		The most important master levels with cooldown are FZ and PS; a tip about PS: the full duration is 10 seconds, but you can delete this buff like other ones! This is very important detail since you can't cast while PS (but you can always /use pots!).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Champion Level's path</b><br>
		The most important champion level ability is disease: get it! then you can buy resists and heals, or cure disease.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Equipment and templates***</b><br>
		For both sniper and hybryd hunters the most important ToA bonuses are spell pircing, spell damage and casting speed.<br>
		here some must have items:
		<ul>
			<li>Golden scarab vest, especially if full sniper</li>
			<li>Golden spear, for the instant interrupt charges!</li>
			<li>Infernal sleeves, for more endurance regen, a perfect combo with the Dragon Power Mythirian</li>
			<li>snare procs on every crafted piece (they interrupt like omni-procs)</li>
			<li>celerity charges on crafted shield (if you want to use your spear), or cure disease/dot</li>
			<li>ML 10 cloak over SoM for the HoT or the buff shear</li>
			<li>champion weapon as one handed sword for the hot</li>
			<li>best spear for the hybrid spec: Voltaic ML10</li>
			<li>best bows: ML10, Tuscar, laby ones</li>
			<li>main Mythirians: safe fall one, Health or Dragon Power Myrhirian(depends on template)</li>
			<li>Strong Potion of Invigoration over the Improved ones(if you can afford them), especially if you don't have Infernal sleeves</li>
			<li>Stealth lores items are not really a must, altho a nice added value if u can fit them into your template!</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Keyboard and mouse setup</b><br>
		/qbind everything and don't keyboard-turn! Use the mouse only for turning, panning camera and targetting (if you got a gaming mouse, you can bind stuff there too).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Escape tools</b><br>
		Good tools to create a gap between you and the enemy are FZ, realm rank 5 ability, archery burst speed (winged helm /use if you have it)<br>
		One tip about the archery speed (burst): it can't be broken by the enemy if you are under PS! so burst plus PS is a fantastic combo!
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Other tips</b><br>
		<ul>
			<li>When shield tanks engage you, don't worry: you can always hit them with poison shots and champion level dot(they stack)</li>
			<li>Remember to always use the archery damage selection buff</li>
			<li>The /s frenzy command works only 10 seconds after you actually summoned your pet</li>
			<li>You can put +stealth on the crafted shield and swap it before stealthing thus saving more imbue points on crafted armo pieces </li>
			<li>At high realm rank you don't need 11/11 archery</li>
			<li>Use Falcons Eye instead of aug dex to increase your bow damage</li>
			<li>When a target is zephyred you can always stun/snare, disease, or damage him with Poison or Acid shot (weapons procs work too)</li>
			<li>Rapid fire is a good way to kill brittle guards and caster's bubble</li>
			<li>If you don't group with other players, you can avoid to reach ML10 and stopping to ML9, so you worth less realm points to the enemy and save your self some bounty points!</li>
			<li>Since ML10 cloak is a summoned item, you can reset its /use cooldown relogging or zoning</li>
		</ul>
